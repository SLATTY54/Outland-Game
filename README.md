# Outland-Game

*First of all, I want to inform you that this project has undergone some modifications (optimization, bug fixing) after the game jam.*

##Presentation

**Outland** is a **2D** game that was made on the occasion of my participation in 2022 in my first game Jam. I did it alone for a weekend. The objective of this game jam was to make a game based on the sea, the ocean and in which the enemies die at once. For this I made a Unity 2D game.

In this repository is all the scripts I made.

## Installation

To install the game, you just need to click on the following **Google drive** link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zhyk03pn6LdHhyZ_rHhMqGenJgEdLZ34?usp=sharing

And download the folder corresponding to your operating system (*windows/mac/linux*).
<br>
Inside this folder you will find an executable that will allow you to launch the game.
